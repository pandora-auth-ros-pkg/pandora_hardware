     * Programming means that a bit can either be left at 0, or programmed from 1 to 0. Changing bits from 0 to 1 requires an erase operation.
     * While bits can be individually programmed from 1 to 0, erasing bits from 0 to 1 must be done in larger chunks (manufacturer dependant 
     * but typically 4Kbyte to 64KByte at a time).
     *
     * Specify how/when erasing is done with the options parameter:
     *
     *    - ForceErase causes len bytes to be erased starting at dest. If a scratch buffer (must be the size of an erase block) is
     *      provided then only the len bytes will be erased. If no scratch buffer is provided then the erase block surrounding
     *      dest will be erased. 
     * 
     *    - EraseAsRequired tests if the destination can be written to without erasing. If it can then no erasing is done. If it 
     *      can't then behaviour is the same as if ForceErase was specified. 
     * 
     *    - CallerErase tests if the destination can be written to without erasing. If it can then a data is written. If it 
     *      can't then an error code is returned and nothing is written. 
     *
     * Scratch should be NULL or the address of an area of RAM that the SPIFI driver can use 
     * to save data during erase operations. If provided, the scratch area should be as large 
     * as the smallest erase size that is available throughout the serial flash device. If scratch 
     * is NULL (zero) and an erase is necessary, any bytes in the first erase block before dest 
     * are left in erased state (all ones), as are any bytes in the last erase block after dest + len
     *
     *  @param dest      Address to write to, highest byte must be 0x00 or 0x28 as in 0x28000000
     *  @param len       Number of bytes to write
     *  @param src       Data to write
     *  @param options   How to handle content of destination
     *  @param verify    Should all writes be verified or not
     *  @param scratch   Used with ForceErase and EraseAsRequired option to preserve content of flash outside of
     *                   written area. Size of buffer must be at least the size of one erase block.
